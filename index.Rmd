## Department of Mathematics \& Statistics

* in the Faculty of Sciences
* 12 faculty in areas ranging from algebra, analysis and discrete math to
finance, statistics, and applied math
* housed with Gzowski College in Enwaayang (3rd floor)

## Degrees

* BSc in Mathematical Economics (joint MATH/ECON) or in Mathematical Physics (joint MATH/PHYS)
<br />

* BSc in Mathematics (single-major, dual-major honours; single-major, dual-major general; minor)
  * Specializations in Mathematical Finance or Statistics (all MATH)
<br />  

* BSc in Financial Science (joint MATH/ADMN/ECON)

## The First Year

In your first year, regardless of which of the above paths you take,
there are four required courses:

<br />

* MATH 1110H or 1111H - Calculus I
* MATH 1120H or 1121H - Calculus II
* MATH 1350H - Linear Algebra I: Matrix Algebra
* MATH 1550H - Probability I: Introduction to Probability

<br/>

In addition, there are two courses, MATH 1051H and 1052H, on non-calculus
statistics, which are optional and do not count toward any of the above degrees.

## The Second Year

In your second year, things start to change, based on your program. Most
of the streams and programs will still take:

* MATH 2110H - Calculus III
* MATH 2120H - Calculus IV

<br />

* MATH 2150H - Ordinary Differential Equations (not *required* for Mathematics majors)
* MATH 2200H - Mathematical Reasoning (not for Mathematical Physics)

<br />

* MATH 2350H - Algebra II: Vector Spaces
* MATH 2560H - Statistics I: Mathematical Statistics

## Upper Years

Once you reach upper-year, aside from the requirement that you take a certain
number of courses, your choices are almost unlimited. If you are a math
major, you specialize in any two of the following; if you are in one of the
other degrees, you simply take a selection of courses from:

<br />

Algebra, Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Statistics, Applied Mathematics,
Finance

<br />
The Mathematics program also has a mandatory 4th year course: MATH 4800H.
Financial Science has three required courses: MATH 3510H, 3560H and 4510H.

## Department Culture

* small, friendly, welcoming
* Student Help Center is a great hub
* lots of open doors, you *will* get to know your professors

<br />

* second-year classes of size 30-60
* third- and fourth-year classes range from 10-30

## Internships and Co-ops

* Internship course available for the BSc in Mathematics - Summers, 3rd and 4th year
* co-op stream available for the BSc in Financial Science - Summer of 2nd year,
Summer of 3rd year, and Fall of 4th year
* opportunities for working as a grader or lab demonstrator for the department,
as well as Student Help Center representative
* community research projects and thesis projects for hands-on learning
